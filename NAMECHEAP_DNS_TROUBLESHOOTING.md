# Namecheap DNS Records Not Showing - Troubleshooting Guide

## ðŸš¨ Problem: Can't find DNS records in Advanced DNS tab

This is a common issue with Namecheap. Here are the solutions:

---

## Solution 1: Check if Domain Uses Namecheap DNS

### Step 1: Check Nameservers
1. In your domain management page, look for **"Nameservers"** section
2. Check if it shows:
   - **"Namecheap BasicDNS"** or
   - **"Namecheap Web Hosting DNS"** or
   - **"Custom DNS"**

### Step 2: If Using Custom DNS
If you see **"Custom DNS"** with different nameservers, you need to:
1. **Change to Namecheap DNS** first
2. **Click "Change"** next to Nameservers
3. **Select "Namecheap BasicDNS"**
4. **Save changes**
5. **Wait 24-48 hours** for nameserver changes to propagate
6. **Then you can manage DNS records**

## Solution 2: Look in Different Tabs

### Check These Tabs:
1. **"Advanced DNS"** (most common)
2. **"DNS"** 
3. **"DNS Management"**
4. **"Zone Editor"**
5. **"DNS Records"**

### If You See "DNS" Tab Instead:
1. Click on **"DNS"** tab
2. Look for **"Add New Record"** button
3. You should see existing records there

## Solution 3: Check Domain Status

### Step 1: Verify Domain is Active
1. Make sure your domain is **"Active"** and not expired
2. Check if there are any **"Pending"** statuses

### Step 2: Check if Domain is Locked
1. Look for **"Domain Lock"** status
2. If locked, you may need to unlock it first

## Solution 4: Alternative Interface

### Try This URL Directly:
1. Go to: `https://ap.www.namecheap.com/domains/domaincontrolpanel/ajlathletics.com/advanceddns`
2. This should take you directly to the Advanced DNS page

### Or Try:
1. Go to: `https://ap.www.namecheap.com/domains/domaincontrolpanel/ajlathletics.com/dns`

## Solution 5: Contact Namecheap Support

### If Nothing Works:

### What to Tell Them:
- "I can't see DNS records in Advanced DNS tab"

## Solution 6: Check if Domain is New

### If Domain is Recently Purchased:
1. **New domains** may take 24-48 hours to show DNS options
2. **Wait 24 hours** and try again
3. **Check domain status** in your account
