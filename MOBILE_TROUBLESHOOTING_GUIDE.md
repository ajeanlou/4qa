# Mobile Access Troubleshooting Guide for ajlathletics.com

## üö® Problem: "Webpage is not available" on iPhone

### Current Status Analysis:
- ‚úÖ **www.ajlathletics.com** ‚Üí Points to Firebase (199.36.158.100)
- ‚ùå **ajlathletics.com** (root domain) ‚Üí No A records found
- ‚ùå **Mobile access failing** due to incomplete DNS setup

---

## üîç Root Cause Identified

**The main issue**: Your root domain `ajlathletics.com` doesn't have proper A records pointing to Firebase servers.

**What's working**: `www.ajlathletics.com` is correctly pointing to Firebase
**What's broken**: `ajlathletics.com` (without www) has no A records

## üõ†Ô∏è Solution: Complete DNS Setup

### Step 1: Update DNS Records in Namecheap

**Go to Namecheap DNS Management:**
1. Login to https://namecheap.com
2. Go to Domain List ‚Üí Manage ajlathletics.com
3. Go to Advanced DNS tab

**Add these A records for the root domain:**
```
Type: A
Host: @
Value: 199.36.158.100
TTL: Automatic

Type: A
Host: @
Value: 199.36.158.101
TTL: Automatic
```

**Keep the existing CNAME record:**
```
Type: CNAME
Host: www
Value: statistics-1dfa4.web.app
TTL: Automatic
```

### Step 2: Verify Firebase Console Setup

**Check Firebase Console:**
1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/statistics-1dfa4/hosting
2. Look for "Custom domains" section
3. Verify both domains are listed:
   - ajlathletics.com
   - www.ajlathletics.com

### Step 3: Wait for DNS Propagation

**Timeline:**
- **Local propagation**: 15-30 minutes
- **Global propagation**: 24-48 hours
- **Mobile networks**: Can take longer (up to 72 hours)
